Open the VS Code terminal by pressing Ctrl + Shift + (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + (Mac).

Navigate to the directory where your local repository is located using the cd command. For example, if your repository is in a directory named "my-project", you can use the command: cd my-project.

Check the status of your local repository using the git status command. This will show you which files have been modified or added.

Add any new or modified files to the staging area using the git add command. For example, you can use the command: git add . to add all the files in the directory to the staging area.

Commit the changes using the git commit command. For example, you can use the command: git commit -m "Add new feature" to commit the changes with a message.

Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub using the git push command. For example, you can use the command: git push origin main to push the changes to the "main" branch of the repository.

Enter your GitHub username and password when prompted to authenticate the push.
